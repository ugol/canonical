# Shredder exercise

## Shred tool in Go

Implement a Shred(path) function that will overwrite the given file (e.g. “randomfile”) 3 times with random data and 
delete the file afterwards. Note that the file may contain any type of data.
You are expected to give information about the possible test cases for your Shred function, including the ones that 
you don’t implement, and implementing the full test coverage is a bonus :)
In a few lines briefly discuss the possible use cases for such a helper function as well as advantages and drawbacks 
of addressing them with this approach.
